## Overview

This PHP Starter demonstrates a simple, reusable PHP web application with MySQL Support.  The app
uses a database to store simple TODO items, and has a page that displays the current weather
conditions for a given zip code.  This code assumes it is deployed to Bluemix, and that services for
MySQL (ClearDB or the Experimental MySQL) and Weather Insights have already been provisioned for 
the app.
